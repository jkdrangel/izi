Fix emoji for thunderbird.

Sorry to bump this thread, but something that worked for me was creating a "fonts" subfolder in Thunderbirds' own folder and placing EmojiOneMozilla.ttf in that folder.

First, download the font itself304.

Second, create a "fonts" folder (you need root access for that):

sudo mkdir /usr/lib/thunderbird/fonts

Finally, place the font file in that folder (mine was saved in ~/Downloads, yours may be in some other place, so change the next line, if needed):

sudo cp ~/Downloads/EmojiOneMozilla.ttf /usr/lib/thunderbird/fonts/

Restart Thunderbird and it's done. Hope it helps!
